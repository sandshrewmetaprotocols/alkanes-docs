# Legacy DIESEL Distribution

This page documents the original distribution mechanism for DIESEL before the contract upgrade at block 909,861.

## How to Get DIESEL (Legacy Method)

### Submit the First tx in a Block to Mint Transaction

- Anyone could broadcast a transaction that calls the DIESEL contract in a given block.
- If your transaction was included before anyone else's, you claimed that block's DIESEL reward.
- Initially, this was more open—over time, miners or other participants might pay closer attention.

### Acquire from Existing Holders

- Once DIESEL started circulating, you could obtain it via peer-to-peer trades, AMMs on ALKANES (e.g., Oyl Swap), or other secondary markets.
- All standard Bitcoin transaction fees still applied—no extra DIESEL fees.
- Because ALKANES runs purely on Bitcoin, the mint process and transfers all occur on-chain, secured by Bitcoin's consensus.

## DIESEL Distribution Overview (Legacy)

**Total Supply:** 1,562,500 DIESEL

### Block 880,000: Official Launch

DIESEL went live when block 880,000 was mined. At this point, the ALKANES indexer started looking for protocol messages—including transactions calling the DIESEL contract.

### Jump Start (Blocks 800,000 → 880,000)

Instead of letting those blocks be minted retroactively, a one-time allocation of roughly 28% of the total DIESEL supply (i.e., 440,000 tokens) was made at block 880,000.

This allocation was earmarked for the OYL protocol team and select community airdrops.

### Remaining ~72%

- Claimed block-by-block in real time as Bitcoin blocks were mined.
- Anyone could submit a mint transaction—no pre-sale, no VC allocations.

### Why the Jump Start?

The jump start covered blocks 800,000 to 880,000, mirroring what Bitcoin's subsidy would have produced in that window. Instead of distributing it block-by-block, that chunk was allocated at once. This granted:

- Driving adoption and Utility for ALKANES development
- Community Engagement through airdrops to early adopters across Bitcoin-based ecosystems.
